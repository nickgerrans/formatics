# The Formatic Mark

## Definition

The Formatic mark is the fundamental structural equation:

```
([()]) = (())
```

This expresses the equivalence between:
- **Left side `([()])` **: The explicit expansion showing orbit structure
- **Right side `(())`**: The collapsed canonical representative

## Structural Components

### Three Core Operators

| Symbol | Name | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `()` | **Slot** | A local container waiting to be filled |
| `[]` | **Orbit/Bound** | Equivalence class operation selecting which orbit a value belongs to |
| `(())` | **Closed Unit** | Terminal/universal closure treating all orbits as equivalent |

### The Mark as Composition

```
([()]) = (())
```

Reads as: *"The closure of an orbit containing a slot equals a collapsed universal closure"*

Or more precisely: *"Wrapping orbit structure in a closure operator yields the same result as direct collapse to the terminal unit"*

## Why This Matters

This is not a chosen notation—it is a **structural invariant** that appears wherever:
1. You have distinguishable slots/objects
2. You can form equivalence classes (orbits/bounds)
3. You have a universal closure/terminal construction

Any system with these three properties will necessarily exhibit the Formatic mark, whether explicitly named or not.
