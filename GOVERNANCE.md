# Formatics Governance Model

This document defines the governance structure, decision-making authority, and maintainer rights for the Formatics project.

## Project Authority

**Nicholas Gerrans** (the copyright holder) has **exclusive and final authority** over all aspects of the Formatics project.

## Decision-Making Rights

The copyright holder has sole authority over:

### 1. Repository Management
- **Merge rights**: All pull requests require approval and merge by the copyright holder
- **Branch management**: Creation/deletion of protected branches
- **Repository settings**: Visibility, access controls, integrations
- **Collaborator access**: Granting or revoking contributor permissions

### 2. Release Management
- **Tagging releases**: Creating version tags and release markers
- **Release timing**: Deciding when versions are stable enough for release
- **Version numbering**: Semantic versioning decisions
- **Release notes**: Content and messaging of releases
- **Distribution channels**: Where and how releases are published

### 3. Intellectual Property
- **Licensing decisions**: Changes to the license or licensing terms
- **Commercial licensing**: Terms and conditions for commercial use
- **Trademark/branding**: Use of the "Formatics" name and associated marks
- **Derivative work approval**: Authorization of derivative works or forks
- **Attribution requirements**: How the project must be cited and credited

### 4. Technical Direction
- **Architecture**: Major structural decisions about code organization
- **API design**: Public interfaces and stability guarantees
- **Dependencies**: Addition or removal of external dependencies
- **Language/platform choices**: Target languages, Python versions, etc.
- **Feature roadmap**: Priority and inclusion of new features

### 5. Theoretical Direction
- **Core definitions**: Changes to fundamental Formatics concepts
- **Axioms and proofs**: Acceptance of theoretical contributions
- **Domain extensions**: New areas where the Formatic mark applies
- **Necessity claims**: Validation of necessity theorems
- **Notation**: Symbolic representation of Formatics structures

### 6. Community and Communication
- **Code of conduct**: Standards for contributor behavior
- **Communication channels**: Official forums, discussion platforms
- **Documentation standards**: Style and organization of docs
- **Issue triage**: Prioritization and labeling of issues
- **Public statements**: Official positions on behalf of the project

## Contributor Roles

### Contributors (External)
- May submit pull requests, issues, and suggestions
- Subject to the Contributor License Agreement (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))
- No decision-making authority
- No ownership rights in the project

### Collaborators (If Designated)
The copyright holder may grant collaborators limited permissions:
- **Triage access**: Label and organize issues
- **Review access**: Comment on pull requests (non-binding)
- **Limited merge access**: Merge pre-approved trivial changes (typos, formatting)

Even with collaborator access:
- All significant changes require copyright holder approval
- Collaborators have no ownership or voting rights
- Access can be revoked at any time without cause

## Transparency and Accountability

While the copyright holder has sole decision-making authority, the project aims for:

### Open Development
- Public issue tracker for bugs and feature requests
- Public pull requests with review comments
- Public commit history showing all changes
- Public documentation of design decisions

### Responsiveness
- Timely review of contributions (target: within 2 weeks)
- Clear communication of rejection reasons
- Public roadmap for major features (when applicable)

### Stability Guarantees
- Semantic versioning for releases
- Deprecation warnings before breaking changes
- Migration guides for major version changes

## Fork Policy

Under the terms of the LICENSE:

### Academic Forks
- **Permitted**: For non-commercial academic research
- **Required**: Clear attribution to original Formatics project
- **Required**: Retain copyright notices and LICENSE
- **Prohibited**: Commercial use without explicit permission
- **Prohibited**: Creating competing frameworks that obscure origin

### Commercial Forks
- **Prohibited** without explicit written permission from the copyright holder
- Contact the copyright holder for commercial licensing terms

## Succession Planning

In the event the copyright holder becomes unable to maintain the project:

1. **Designated successor**: The copyright holder may designate a successor in writing
2. **Default**: If no successor is designated, copyright and governance remain with the copyright holder's estate
3. **No community takeover**: Contributors do not acquire rights through abandonment or inactivity

## Changes to Governance

This governance model may be changed **only by the copyright holder**.

Changes will be:
- Documented in git history
- Announced via commit messages or release notes
- Effective immediately upon commit to the main branch

## Dispute Resolution

For disputes regarding:
- Contribution acceptance/rejection
- License interpretation
- Governance decisions
- Intellectual property claims

**The copyright holder's decision is final.**

For legal disputes, the governing law is [to be specified by copyright holder].

## Rationale

This centralized governance model exists because:

1. **Theoretical integrity**: Formatics is a discovered mathematical structure, not a designed software product. Maintaining theoretical coherence requires unified direction.

2. **IP protection**: The Formatic mark and associated theory are valuable intellectual property. Centralized control prevents fragmentation and misappropriation.

3. **Academic credibility**: Clear ownership and attribution are essential for academic citation and recognition.

4. **Commercial licensing**: Future commercial licensing requires unambiguous ownership chain.

5. **Anti-hijacking**: Prevents hostile forks or attempts to obscure the project's origins.

## Contact

For questions about governance:
- Open an issue for public discussion
- Contact the copyright holder directly for private matters
